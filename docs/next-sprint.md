# Next Sprint Goals

The upcoming development cycle will focus on two main objectives:

1. **Expand the sign vocabulary**. Continue gathering labelled examples and fine tune models so the app can recognise a broader set of static and dynamic signs.
2. **Improve offline support**. Package more models with the PWA and explore lighter formats so users can run the demo without an internet connection.

These tasks will move the prototype closer to production readiness and provide a better experience for rural and low bandwidth communities.
