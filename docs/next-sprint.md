# Next Sprint Goals

The upcoming development cycle will address three focus areas:

## 1. Expand vocabulary and models
- Continue gathering labelled examples to cover more static and dynamic signs.
- Package additional models with the PWA so it works fully offline.
- Offer an option to switch between GPU and CPU inference and download updated models in the background.

## 2. Improve user interface and accessibility
- Detect the preferred colour scheme on load and provide accessible palettes for colour blindness.
- Add a language selector, mirrored controls for leftâ€‘handed users and the ability to reposition subtitles.
- Allow adjusting subtitle opacity, spacing and fonts; store these settings in `localStorage`.
- Use smooth animations for opening the settings and help panels.
- Indicate model confidence with coloured borders and show progress bars when downloading assets.
- Extend the help screen with contextual tips and collapsible FAQ sections.
- Provide keyboard and voice shortcuts for common actions.

## 3. Training and feedback features
- Draw hand trajectories and heatmaps on the canvas in real time.
- Display charts with statistics of detected signs over time.
- Include a dictionary of signs with short animations and confirmation when each gesture is performed correctly.
- Allow exporting transcripts or session recordings to share progress.

These initiatives aim to deliver a more polished and robust experience while keeping an offline-first approach.
